About me:

Hi, my name is Angelo and I am a student majoring in Computer Science at the University of San Francisco. Currently, I am a student assistant for the Department of Justice's, IT California Law Enforcement Telecommunications System (CLETS) division. I am eager to gain experience and network with others in the tech field which is why I have taken on CTI accelerate and the micro-internship. I am excited for this opportunity and look forward to working with everyone. Fun fact about me is that I love the Golden State Warriors and I pray every night that we can somehow turn this season around.
